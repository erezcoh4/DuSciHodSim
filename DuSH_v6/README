v6 Jan-04, 2020
Changes from v5:
------------------
1) input from xml file

2) define detector surface area to provide dynamic information on "photon detected by detector"

3) change main input: 
> ./RunProgram <configuration> <verbosity> 

4)Evaluate the number of scintillation photons produced from photon yield in MeVee, since these are the units in which the scintillators vendor work. So now also convert from MeV to MeVee.




v5 Dec-20, 2019
Changes from v4:
------------------
1) Added proton emission and propagation towards detector
	(A) added ProtonModule and a Proton class
	(B) proton emits scintillation photons


2) Removed FaceModule

3) Added "auxiliary" class and moved some of the functionality previously derived by "version" class

4) photon absorbed (or not) in paddle following "radiation-length" decay


v4 Dec-18, 2019
Changes from v3:
------------------
1) Added output to CSV:
First stage writing photon propagation properties
	(A) arrived to front facet (boolean)
	(B) emission direction (x,y,z)
Output data will be written to 
	/Users/erezcohen/Desktop/data/DuSiHodSim/output/csv_files/

2) Added argument inputs to software
	verbose = atoi(argv[1]);  // verbosity
	Nphotons = atoi(argv[2]); // number of photons to generate
	refractiveIndex = atof(argv[3]); // scintillator refractive index

3) added first analysis macro to /mac/ as a Jupyter notebook that plots trapping efficiency
	
	


v3 Dec-6, 2019
Changes from v2:
------------------
1) Added a photon as TPolyLine3D




v2 Dec-2, 2019
Changes from v1:
------------------
1) compiled with ROOT cern libraries using 
	LDFLAGS += -L$(shell root-config --libdir) -lEG -lSpectrum -lHist

2) added version.hpp
